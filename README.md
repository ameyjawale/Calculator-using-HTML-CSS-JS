# Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS
This is a very basic beginner level mini project which is a calculator using html,css and javascript. although it has 1 or 2  bugs (not in normal operation but in functions like for some specific complex calculations doesn't work which can be solved by adding some if-else conditions in existing functions in the .js file)
